# Temporal Python SDK Samples

This directory contains sample Workflow applications that demonstrate the various capabilities of the Temporal Server via the Temporal Python SDK.

## How to use

Make sure the Temporal Server is running locally.
Follow the [Quick install guide](https://docs.temporal.io/docs/server-quick-install) to do that.

Then, clone this repository and follow the instructions in the README that is included with each sample.
The [hello-world](./hello-world/README.md) sample is a good place to start.

You can learn more about running the Server locally in the [temporalio/docker-compose README](https://github.com/temporalio/docker-compose/blob/main/README.md).
And you can learn more about the Temporal Server technology in general via the [documentation](https://docs.temporal.io/).
